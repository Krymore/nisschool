<p>Looking for the answers to different questions of all subjects always brings to math, because it has great power to address any task. My first acquaintance with this mathematics of calculus, differential equations and linear algebra was with MIT OpenCourseWare. So, the jingle “This following content is provided under a creative commons license … <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu">ocw.mit.edu</a>” became my potent stimulus for math enlightenment as a bell ring to Pavlov’s dogs for food. By becoming part of math department to study applied math, I hope to start turning beautiful structures of math to real solutions of real-world problems again with MIT.</p>
