How has that world shaped your dreams and aspirations?</h2>
<p>During the rationality camp, one girl was learning how to count up to ten in different languages, and I taught her how to do it in Kazakh. When she finally reached ten, I noticed that her accent reminded those of Kazakh politicians when they could not properly read what their employees wrote for them.</p>
<p>The world, the country I came from is where most people neglect and contempt for their mother tongue language. Somehow starting with conversations with conductors on buses and ending with parliament sessions, other language used as a standard. “You may know all the languages of the world, but you should respect your own.”  Kazakh poet’s words written during the Soviet’s strong language politics, unfortunate relevant for even now after 30 years of Independence.</p>
<p>In one interview some popular science magazine founders stated that as an academic language Kazakh is already dead. Why should we sit and watch how the most significant part of our culture is fading? I was disappointed by their opinion but turned my anger on inaction into motivation to open some media or magazine where people translate popular articles and news. Sharing the idea with my friends we decided to open an online magazine and called it as “Shyraq”, Kazakh translation for “lamp”, which contributes to light up the future of my mother language. Beeing member of the country that wants to retain its culture and values, one of my biggest dream is to contribute to the development and widening range of Kazakh.</p>
