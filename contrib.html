MIT students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world’s biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way in which you have contributed to your community, whether in your family, the classroom, your neighborhood, etc. (200-250 words)</h2>
<p>Each year, there are two types of 7th-grade students who enter NIS math camp: those whose trainers have already explained them such terms as quadratic residues and those who have barely seen equality signs with three sticks — non-surprisingly on every camp second half cut from the team list. Again and again, the team became more polarised on top schools, leaving behind others, including mine.</p>
<p>What disappointed me in this situation was that I knew a lot of young, talented, and capable students. Still, nobody took part in olympiads because of the absence of external support. Hoping to find and help them, I opened small math lessons as part of summer school and invited all interested ones. We looked at math from different angles, covered topics beyond the school curriculum. To make my classes both fun and useful, instead of regular classes, I sometimes organised math games, such as math casino or sea-battle, where solved problems served as bullets.</p>
<p>During this week, I found myself in sharing math with people full of dreams in their eyes. Later I scheduled our lessons during the school year to work with more students. My math club worked on Mondays and Thursdays. Those were three years full of preparation and fun, leading to medals in Olympiads as a bonus. When my students are awarded in school, I am proud of I their hard work and hope that I have somehow contributed to their adventure in a strict but beautiful, infinite world of mathematics.</p>
