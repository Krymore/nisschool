MIT students work to improve their communities in different ways, from tackling the world’s biggest challenges to being a good friend. Describe one way in which you have contributed to your community, whether in your family, the classroom, your neighborhood, etc. (200-250 words)</h2>
<p>Each year, there are two types of 7th-grade students who enter the NIS math camp: those whose trainers have already explained to them terms like quadratic residues, and those who have barely seen a triple bar — unsurprisingly the second half are cut from the team list during every camp. Again and again, teams are made of students from only the top schools, leaving behind others, including mine.</p>
<p>What disappointed me in this situation was that I knew a lot of young, talented, and capable students from our school. Still, none of them took part in olympiads because of the absence of external support. Hoping to find and help them, I started running small math lessons as part of a summer school and invited all the interested ones. We looked at math from different angles and covered topics beyond the school curriculum. To make my classes both fun and useful, instead of regular classes, I sometimes organised math games, such as math casino or sea-battle, where problems they solved would serve as bullets.</p>
<p>Those were three weeks, and subsequently, three years full of preparation and fun, leading to medals in Olympiads as a bonus. When my students are awarded in school, I am proud of their hard work, and I hope that I have somehow contributed to their adventure in the strict but beautiful, infinite world of mathematics.</p>
