Tell us about something you do for the pleasure of it. (*)(100 words or fewer)</h2>
<p>I enjoy gathering in the school’s studio every Saturday till late evening and picking heavy strings of bass with my rock band.</p>
<p>Short stunning sound. Changing belt tension. Touching the heavy metal bass strings. It is how I start playing with my rock band. Forgetting vanity of school life, we refine repertoire or dabble with sounding. Holding a bass guitar, I try new things, take risks and simply relax. From first notes, the music we play flows into ears and hugs and possesses our minds and bodies.  But when we are on the stage, we share this ecstasy with the audience. The light in listeners’ eyes, their applause, a good exhausted after a performance and just “alive” music makes me happy.</p>
